      The computer will choose a secret sequence of four colors. The player must guess the sequence in ten turns.
      The player can guess any 4-element combinations of (r)ed, (g)reen, (b)lue and (y)ellow (ex. GYBB).
      Itâ€™s possible that the computer might use a single color for the entire sequence (ex. RRRR).
      After each guess, the computer will inform the player whether any colors within the guess are the right color and in the right position.
      You are limited to ten guesses. See if you can crack the code!
      Good luck!"
